# 🚀 Lvl Up
Lvl Up is a cross-platform mobile application developed as a submission for 
Envisage's Hack-ur-way 2025 hackathon by Shubham Singh, Anuj Agarwal, and 
Abhinav Kumar Lal. Built with Flutter, it aims to enhance personal 
productivity and habit formation through a gamified experience that motivates 
users to achieve daily goals, build consistent routines, and level up their 
real-life skills.

## 🧠 Features
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Seamlessly runs on Android, Windows, and Linux.


Feature-rich UI: Intuitive and user-friendly interface with thrice as many 
features than your normal to-do list and other productivity apps.


Gamified Task Management: Complete tasks to gain XP, unlock levels, and 
maintain daily streaks.


Real-time Progress Tracking: Visualize your progress with dynamic charts and 
motivational summaries.

## 🛠️ Installation
You can directly download the apk from 
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/ShubhamVG/Lvl_Up/releases/tag/v1.0). It 
should work for most, if not all, android phones and architectures.


If the above does not work for some reason, then you can **build from source** 
as well.

## Pre-requisites
Pick your requirements as stated on the 
[flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) website.

## Steps
1. Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ShubhamVG/Lvl_Up.git
$ cd Lvl_Up
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash

```

3. Building the application on PC

You can either build the app, or choose just to run it. Either choose 
`flutter run --release` or `flutter build --release` based on which one suits 
you.

4. Building the app for android

To build for android, run this command:
```bash
$ flutter build apk --release
```
